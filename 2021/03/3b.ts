// Next, you should verify the life support rating, which can be determined by
// multiplying the oxygen generator rating by the CO2 scrubber rating.

// Both the oxygen generator rating and the CO2 scrubber rating are values
// that can be found in your diagnostic report - finding them is the tricky
// part. Both values are located using a similar process that involves
// filtering out values until only one remains. Before searching for either
// rating value, start with the full list of binary numbers from your
// diagnostic report and consider just the first bit of those numbers. Then:

// Keep only numbers selected by the bit criteria for the type of rating value
// for which you are searching. Discard numbers which do not match the bit
// criteria.

// If you only have one number left, stop; this is the rating value for which
// you are searching.

// Otherwise, repeat the process, considering the next bit to the right.

// The bit criteria depends on which type of rating value you want to find:

// To find oxygen generator rating, determine the most common value (0 or 1)
// in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that
// position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 1 in the
// position being considered.

// To find CO2 scrubber rating, determine the least common value (0 or 1) in
// the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that
// position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 0 in the
// position being considered.

// For example, to determine the oxygen generator rating value using the same
// example diagnostic report from above:

// Start with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number.
// There are more 1 bits (7) than 0 bits (5), so keep only the 7 numbers with
// a 1 in the first position: 11110, 10110, 10111, 10101, 11100, 10000, and
// 11001.

// Then, consider the second bit of the 7 remaining numbers: there are more 0
// bits (4) than 1 bits (3), so keep only the 4 numbers with a 0 in the second
// position: 10110, 10111, 10101, and 10000.

// In the third position, three of the four numbers have a 1, so keep those
// three: 10110, 10111, and 10101.

// In the fourth position, two of the three numbers have a 1, so keep those
// two: 10110 and 10111.

// In the fifth position, there are an equal number of 0 bits and 1 bits (one
// each). So, to find the oxygen generator rating, keep the number with a 1 in
// that position: 10111.

// As there is only one number left, stop; the oxygen generator rating is
// 10111, or 23 in decimal.

// Then, to determine the CO2 scrubber rating value from the same example
// above:

// Start again with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each
// number. There are fewer 0 bits (5) than 1 bits (7), so keep only the 5
// numbers with a 0 in the first position: 00100, 01111, 00111, 00010, and
// 01010.

// Then, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer 1
// bits (2) than 0 bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a 1 in the second
// position: 01111 and 01010.

// In the third position, there are an equal number of 0 bits and 1 bits (one
// each). So, to find the CO2 scrubber rating, keep the number with a 0 in
// that position: 01010.

// As there is only one number left, stop; the CO2 scrubber rating is 01010,
// or 10 in decimal.

// Finally, to find the life support rating, multiply the oxygen generator
// rating (23) by the CO2 scrubber rating (10) to get 230.

// Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the oxygen
// generator rating and CO2 scrubber rating, then multiply them together. What
// is the life support rating of the submarine? (Be sure to represent your
// answer in decimal, not binary.)
