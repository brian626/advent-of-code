// --- Day 14: Regolith Reservoir ---

// The distress signal leads you to a giant waterfall! Actually, hang on - the signal seems like it's coming from the waterfall itself,
// and that doesn't make any sense. However, you do notice a little path that leads behind the waterfall.

// Correction: the distress signal leads you behind a giant waterfall! There seems to be a large cave system here, and the signal
// definitely leads further inside.

// As you begin to make your way deeper underground, you feel the ground rumble for a moment. Sand begins pouring into the cave!
// If you don't quickly figure out where the sand is going, you could quickly become trapped!

// Fortunately, your familiarity with analyzing the path of falling material will come in handy here. You scan a two-dimensional
// vertical slice of the cave above you (your puzzle input) and discover that it is mostly air with structures made of rock.

// Your scan traces the path of each solid rock structure and reports the x,y coordinates that form the shape of the path,
// where x represents distance to the right and y represents distance down. Each path appears as a single line of text in your scan.
// After the first point of each path, each point indicates the end of a straight horizontal or vertical line to be drawn from the
// previous point.

// Using your scan, simulate the falling sand. How many units of sand come to rest before sand starts flowing into the abyss below?
